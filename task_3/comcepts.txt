--> MODEL VIEW TEMPLATE ARCHTECTURE

MVT is Django's Architecture where Models, Views and Templates control how the application works

Every object or instance is a model and is mapped to a database (usually automatically maintained according to class definiton)

Views are logic handling instances where requests are recieved and entertained, data is processed and responses are returned

Templates are endpoints such as HTML pages and can have Statics and other helpers such as JS


--> GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH 

GET retrieve items
/products/ returns all products
/products/4/ returns product id 4

POST inserts an item

DELETE removes items

PUT replaces a whole item, all fields must be sent

PATCH replaces the fields of item that are sent

REQUESTS ARE STATELESS AND ARE SENT IN FORMS SUCH AS JSON

such as

POST /books/
Content-Type: application/json

  "year": 1949
